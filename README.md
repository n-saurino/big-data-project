# NYC City Safety and Livability Analysis
## Project Partners:
- Nigel Saurino (NS5329)
- Devarsh Patel (DP3324)
- Priyank Viradia (PDV8883)

## Objective:
- Identifying the preferable place in NYC for students to live in terms of crime and
transportation using historic dataset provided NYC via their open data initiative.  

## Data Sets:
- https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/
- https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u
- https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i
- https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Criminal-Court-Summons-Historic-/sv2w-rv3k
- https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Real-Time-Traffic-Speed-Data/qkm5-nuaq
- https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Turnstile-Usage-Data-2014/i55r-43gk
- http://web.mta.info/developers/data/nyct/subway/Stations.csv

## Proposal:
- Data collection: Using a combination of APIâ€™s and raw data downloads primarily from the
NYC open data initiative to collect a comprehensive data set covering transportation,
crime, income level, school district, apartment/living expense.
- Clean and pre-process data: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure that it is ready for
analysis. This may involve removing missing or erroneous data, standardizing data
formats, and merging data from different datasets.
- Data correlation: Identify the correlation between the different datasets in order to
establish a relationship between them and suggest optimal living neighborhoods for
students.
- Insight - Explore different methods for synthesizing data into actionable insight.
Potentially ML classification problem that could leverage common python ML libraries.
- Conclusions - Visualizations such as a heat map and/or website (application)

## Assumptions:
- We believe that MTA buses are not going to be a primary mode of transportation for
students as it is heavily dependent on traffic and frequency. It also requires more time to
commute than local and express trains
